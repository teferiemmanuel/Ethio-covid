I have four Years Experience as an Anesthetist and one of my major responsibilities was dealing with patients Airways, especially in Emergency Scenarios. Right now the Hospitals are not well equipped to deal with Airway Emergencies. Oxygen is an important part of Emergency Airway management and right now, DIL CHORA GAS is the only place for the Entire Country that you can get Oxygen Cylinders refilled. This can pose a major problem. I suggest we Start to look for other sources of Oxygen, like Oxygen Concentrator .

This are essential in Airway Emergencies and can be built easily by up cycling plastic bottles or other plastic materials.
