I don't think it is something that works in our setting (Ethiopia) ...\nI was thinking of ways where we can help people create groups that collectively agree and quarantine themselves \u2026 these clusters will only have one contact (volunteer) with the outside. The Volunteer can handle small purchases and rationed foods (I would hope the government will provide that to vulnerable parts of our cities) \u2026 by having a group of 25-50 people in each cluster we can, hopefully maintain the spread. Otherwise, if we all go shop for food or do our daily routines, it will easily spread.\nWe can utilize whatsup (no need to develop something) and arrange groups by physical proximity / Gorebet / sefers / kebeles."
