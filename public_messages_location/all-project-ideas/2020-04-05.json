                "text": "Even though China maintained the outbreak of COVID-19 within the country, other countries such as the USA and Italy became the new hotspots for the virus. As the number of infected rises rapidly in these countries, the demand for specialists that are qualified and equipment is increasing as well. Due to the deficit of equipment, ISINNOVA engineers have made it their job to try and solve these problems. These engineers have teamed up with medical experts and Decathlon to alter full-face snorkeling masks into masks which can be added to medical breathing machines. This will help many people that are infected with the COVID-19 virus and require breathing equipment. With the shortages of breathing masks worldwide, this genius conversion couldn\u2019t come in a better time. Dr. Renato Favero, former head physician at the Gardone Valtrompia Hospital approached the engineers Alessandro Romaiol and Cristian Fracassi of the Italian engineering company, ISINNOVA. Dr. Renato had the idea to soften the shortage of C-PAP masks which became a deficit since the corona outbreak. The hospitals are using C-PAP masks for sub-intensive therapy. When COVID-19 reached Italy (first confirmed case on January 29 this year), the need for these masks increased. Due to the short supply of these masks, Dr. Favero suggested modifying already available masks used by scuba divers into the masks that can be used by ventilating machines. Decathlon, a sporting goods retailer, rose to the challenge and was included in the project as the producer and supplier for the Easybreath snorkeling masks. After they got involved, ISINNOVA took the CAD designs for the snorkeling masks and used them to create the needed modifications. They also included the designs and 3D printing of Charlotte and Dave valves which are the parts that connect the masks to the breathing machine tubes. ISINNOVA made a statement on their web page that tests were made on the prototype on one of their colleagues in Chiari Hospital. The test came out successful and the hospital later tested the prototype on a patient in need. The modified ventilation mask worked perfectly and the doctors that tested it were very satisfied. The blueprints and instructions on how to make the masks were made available online for free by ISINNOVA. Hospitals can now buy the Easybreath snorkeling masks from Decathlon for \u20ac25 instead of their normal price which starts at around \u20ac100. The valves they can 3D print on their own. Not only does this lessen the solution for the mask crisis, but it also helps the hospitals and governments from lots of additional expenses. There\u2019s also a 5-step video tutorial posted on YouTube with details for the assembly of the masks. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Csqdxkrfw> Even though this is amazing news, there is one setback. Snorkeling experts claim that the full face masks can be dangerous due to the buildup of carbon dioxide inside of the mask. This can happen if an improper air outtake is provided. Additionally, the mask shortage is not the only thing that needs to be solved at the moment. There\u2019s also a shortage of ventilators for people to use. The engineering company made a note that the masks should be used if they are necessary since the mask and the link valves are not certified. Statements on their website read that the masks are made for hospitals and other healthcare facilities in difficult situations where there\u2019s no alternative for supplies.",
