Then the question is can we do what the Czechs did? I doubt we will be able to, because we might not have enough tools and input materials for making it happen. Even if we did, it might take weeks to reach the level of production that is helpful, or we might want these masks to be first available to the individuals at high risk of contracting the virus and who's services are of utmost importance , for example,  Health Extension Workers, firefighters, police officers and other service providers. I am not saying it is impossible just the cost in time might be too high.\n\nBut, I think we have one cultural advantage, Natela (\u1290\u1320\u120b). The advantage I see are,\n1. significant number of the population have it. Thus, financial cost will not be a hindrance for most,\n2. adaptation of its use can be achieved rapidly. Thus, it doesn't have much cost in time,\n3. Similar communication as used by the Czechs government can be used "

Thus, it doesn't conflict with existing messaging of not using masks unless you are sick.\n\nA possible disadvantage of using Natela (\u1290\u1320\u120b) is its various form factors. Describing how many time to fold before wearing might differ depending on the different thicknesses. But I am not a marketer, or professional health communicator, so it might not be a big issue.\n\nWhat do you think?"
