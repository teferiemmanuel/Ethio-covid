We can work in parallel with this group <https://gitlab.com/openventilator> and we can work closely with the Addis Abeba Science and Technology University AASTU to have the prototype tested. I can take responsibility of the PCB layout design, fabrication of the boards and assembly of the boards. Eventually we can have the board assembly be done in Ethiopia. But for now we can focus on getting on prototype so it is tested. Please let me know what you think.",
