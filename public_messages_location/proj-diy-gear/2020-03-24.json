There needs to be some kind of filter--even if it is not the N95 filter.\n\nAdditionally, the mask has to seal to your face, which is why N95 masks are more structured than cloth masks. This is so air only goes through the filter and not around and into gaps in your mask.\n\nThere is a local makerspace near my workplace (containing many of my colleagues) that is having their 3D-printed masks tested by a local hospital. They are still waiting for validation from the hospital, but I believe their method may work in an emergency, and I can report back on whether the test was successful. If it is successful, then I believe this is one of few DIY designs that may work.\n\nTheir instructions are here: <https://lowellmakes.com/covid-19-response/> They're using furnace filter material instead.\n\nAnyone currently working on mask manufacturing in ET?",
