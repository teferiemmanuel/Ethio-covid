EMMU will have a team of 200 health professionals (doctors, nurses, lab technicians, radiographers, epidemiologists and logisticians). The members will be volunteers who sign up to be mobilized in a short notice. Responsibilities, expectations and benefits will be discussed soon in more detail. Enrollment will be open for the first 500 applicants. After further screening, 200 will be selected for membership. Members will be on call in the form of a rotation.\nMembers will be certified for various skills such as ACLS, ATLS, PALS and BLS. The Unit will be highly equipped with advanced medical technology and communication devices. The team will be mobilized at a moment's notice to help stabilize a town, a city, a region or a country in collaboration with the MOH and other international organizations. EMMU will also participate in various international medical missions in addition to the local activities.\nWe have a good working relationship with Abyssinia Airline. We will continue to use them in addition to ET for all of our needs related to logistics (mobilizing our team, transporting our resources as well as for our rescue operations). Besides the considerable humanitarian impact this initiative will have, it will also give positive publicity for our country.\nPlease share this with your friends. Interested individuals can contact Dr. Tinsae Alemayehu at: <mailto:tigisttinsae@gmail.com|tigisttinsae@gmail.com>\nP.S. The training on mechanical ventilation is going well and we have already trained 43 professionals. The training has been highly appreciated by the attendees and we have plan to to scale it up.\nAkeza Teame, MD\nFounder of American Medical Center \n\nT.me/wopportunities",
