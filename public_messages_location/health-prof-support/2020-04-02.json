        "text": "I would like to give some thoughts and reflection after being both in the ER and ward of covid19 patients. This is my experience and trends we are continuously changing at the hospital I am working in. Much of what we are doing does not rest on evidence, rather it is more of a trial and error system. However some things seem to be preferred, and other things are likely to change.\n\n1) treatment with chloroquine was started but the infectious diseases department is now almost stopping it. The reason being side effects mainly on the heart. \n\n2) the ICU department is higly selective in choosing patients to intubate. Age over 80, comorbidities like hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer are almost excluding factors, even in patients under 80. We calculate the PFI (pO2/fi02) for ARDS, and anyone below 21 is in moderate stage, and should be evaluated by an intensivist. Meanwhile if we have patients who come in with 15L on oxygen mask, saturation 90-95, RR &gt;30, there is a high probability they need quick intubation and so many of them go straight from the ER to ICU (if they fill criterias for ICU treatment). \n\n3) we give low molecular heparin prophylaxis to almost all patients. Pulmonary embolism is very common for our in patients. If it is the cytokine storm leading to high inflammatory response, or immobilization, is unknown. However, for patients who might have a mild covid19 for a while, and then come in presenting with shortness of breath and desaturation; PE, bacterial super infection and  worsening of the actual covid19, should all be considered as differential diagnosis. The troponins should also be followed as we are seeing myocarditis and acute heart failure.\n\n4) Sweden is one of the leading countries in the fight against antibiotic resistance. We are very careful not to prescribe antibiotics where there is not an absolute indication. Meanwhile, treating covid19 patients, we seems to have complete gone against this principle. Even though blood cultures are not showing growth of bacteria, we are giving ceftriaxone iv to almost all in patients who are between moderate and severe ARDS\n\n5) The PCR testing method with the nasopharynx swab is not completely reliable. If you highly suspect covid19, but the swab is negative, retake the test or do a chest x-ray or CT-scan. Clinical presentation together with radiology findings can support the diagnosis. \n\n\n5) PPE. Unfortunately, in Sweden, we have been a bit late when it comes to protection percussion. Due to lack of equipment we are trying to save as much PPE as possible, which sometimes puts the health care personal and patients at risk. It is vital to use the right protection at all times. WHO has good recommendations, and if those protocols are followed, that is good. You should also be aware to protect your mind. It is exhausting to work in this environment. I have had 2 night shifts in a row, and I cant remember being this mentally exhausted ever. Be nice to each other, talk to each other, communicate and cooperate. Take breaks. \n\nI hope this is helpful.",
