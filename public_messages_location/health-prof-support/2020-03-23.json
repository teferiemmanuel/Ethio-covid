The main measure to take for you and your department as this unfolds is to ISOLATE\u00a0patients with symptoms/known\u00a0contact/recent\u00a0travel\u00a0to affected areas. This should occur at triage/preop/ED as patients are coming in\u00a0BEFORE\u00a0they spread\u00a0the virus to other patients and healthcare workers.\u00a0Patient visitors should be completely banned to come into the\u00a0hospital. We have stopped all patient visitors from entering the hospital here, unless it is a patient who\u00a0is\u00a0under 18, developmentally delayed, unable to communicate with staff etc. If you need dedicated translators for patients who don't speak amharigna, you can urge the hospital to work on providing translators so you can minimize the amount of people entering in and out of the hospital.\n2. all patients who are coming into the hospital should be registered as they are coming in and out, including which department they are going to. this will help trace potential spread.\n3. Cancel all electives cases, which you have already done.\u00a0\n4. train essential staff (anesthesia, nursing, ICU, ED, ward nurses, surgeons)\u00a0on proper use of PPE, particularly when taking it OFF which is when most of the contamination happens. you should\u00a0have a dedicated trash bin where all materials contaminated with covid 19/PUI are thrown in.\u00a0If you run out of N95 masks, try to think outside of the box, possibly urging hospital and MOH to manufacture clothes masks? the CDC here is starting to insinuate any mask might be useful...when there is\u00a0nothing, anything is better.\u00a0\n5. the minimum essentials for\u00a0PPE\u00a0is\u00a0MASK (N95\u00a0\u00a0preferably), GOWN, GLOVES and EYE COVER.\u00a0OR\u00a0staff will need shoe\u00a0cover\u00a0as well.\u00a0\n6. run simulations (hands on practice) throughout the week on how to put\u00a0PPE\u00a0on and\u00a0off.\u00a0\n7. WASHING\u00a0hands of all healthcare workers before and after\u00a0caring\u00a0for ANY\u00a0patients should be\u00a0strictly enforced.\n8. All patients\u00a0coming into the hospital should first\u00a0wash their hands at the\u00a0door, regardless if\u00a0COVID or not.\n9. warn staff\u00a0NOT\u00a0to take out masks outside of hospital to give to family members. this should come from higher\u00a0up and should be strictly enforced. half of the reason why we are\u00a0lacking\u00a0masks\u00a0here is because\u00a0workers\u00a0kept on\u00a0taking them\u00a0to their\u00a0family.\n10. staff\u00a0# should be minimized.\u00a0unnecessary\u00a0staff should\u00a0GO\u00a0home. it is\u00a0better to call staff on a need basis than expose everyone to the virus and\u00a0run out of workforce. as elective\u00a0cases\u00a0get\u00a0cancelled you will have\u00a0many workers sitting around, tell\u00a0them to go home and stay home, call them\u00a0when\u00a0you need them or as\u00a0workers start getting sick, this will inevitably happen.\u00a0\n11. you should also meet\u00a0with ICU,\u00a0anesthesia and\u00a0EM\u00a0team\u00a0to\u00a0come\u00a0up with a coherent plan. if\u00a0a patient who is suspected or\u00a0affected comes in, what are the steps\u00a0to intubation and\u00a0ICU. this should be a uniform process.\u00a0\n12. when the patient comes to the OR, he/should should wear a normal\u00a0mask.\u00a0\n13. for intubation, 2\u00a0providers a recommended.\u00a0one who will intubate, the other one who can push drugs. intubation should be RSI for all patients, no LMA/masking as you are trying\u00a0to minimize aerosolization of particles.\u00a0the cuff should\u00a0be inflated\u00a0as soon as possible and connected to the\u00a0circuit. the circuit\u00a0once connected should not\u00a0be disconnected\u00a0FOR any reason, unless\u00a0something discussed extensively\u00a0with you or\u00a0other team mates. if you need to suction patient, the tip of the suction should be contained after suction. here\u00a0we have inline suction which is helpful,\u00a0it is already connected to\u00a0ETT.\u00a0\n14. both intubating providers should have full PPE.\n15. any health worker taking care of patient should have full PPE\nhope this helps.",
