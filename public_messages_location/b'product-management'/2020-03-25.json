Spoke with Tigabu of Eshi Express today and he helped me understand what is being done on the ground today by the delivery services. He said that the most important thing that can be done is spread the word about the services - would be helpful if we could use social media (influencers/MoH) to spread the word. They are already cutting delivery costs to make it more accessible - I think we might be able to help subsidize it even further if necessary with some fundraising. He also gave me direct contact info for RIDE, ZayRide, Asbeza, and Kedame Gebeya founders so I'm going to be calling/texting them. I'm busy with work right now but I will formalize my thoughts and get back to those interested in pushing this project forward.",
