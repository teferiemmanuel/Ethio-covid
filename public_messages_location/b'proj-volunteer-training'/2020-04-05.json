As the number of articles are overwhelming plus it should be selected as per relevancy and having a local contexts per the HCP documentation. We were hoping to include the scientist/ helath care professional association to review and we provide the HCP continuous update when needs be. This is not a training but more to collect  our local  findings and how the protocol is similar or different from the rest etc.If there is any update then we can provide it and the HCP would use it as reference. I would see it as website / app that can easily be updated? We need tech support here.\nWhat do think? I can volunteer to lead this project with one or two co leaders  and would require all of your support and hands in reaching our goal and mobilizing the stakeholders",

As the number of articles are overwhelming plus it should be selected as per relevancy and having a local contexts per the HCP documentation. We were hoping to include the scientist/ helath care professional association to review and we provide the HCP continuous update when needs be. This is not a training but more to collect  our local  findings and how the protocol is similar or different from the rest etc.If there is any update then we can provide it and the HCP would use it as reference. I would see it as website / app that can easily be updated? We need tech support here.\nWhat do think? I can volunteer to lead this project with one or two co leaders  and would require all of your support and hands in reaching our goal and mobilizing the stakeholders"
