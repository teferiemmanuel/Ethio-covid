The fastest way to test things, if you are running the server locally, is to expose your 5000 port using ngrok.\n\n0. Update the `messeger\\config\\default.json` with your FB Application secrets from their <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started/app-setup|getting started guide>.\n1. Start the node application on port 5000\n\n```\nnode app.js\n\n```\n\n2. Sanity check that the application is up by opening `<http://localhost:5000>` in a browser\n3. In a separate terminal run:\n\n```\nngrok http 5000\n\n```\n\nNOTE:  \nIn the long run, these should really be one server with different endpoints for each bot telegram, messenger, etc.",
