If that is something MoH is going to start doing, our software systems should be able to support it.\n\n- Recommend who to test in a pool. IMO as layman, I think it's better to test people that are likely going to have the same result. People who flew together for example. Or family members... So the software system should be able to make the connections and suggest whom to include in a pool\n- Suggest paths on how to search for false positives. A healthy person in a pool needs to be identified. When another round of testing takes place, the same person should not be tested with the same group of people. Based on risk metrics, we can suggest a new group of people to test with. If the person is not showing symptoms, we could test her/him with a group of people who are likely not infected.\n\nThe data that is to collected would be bigger than what I would like it to be. But the data would give us more insight into how the virus is spreading.\nType of data I have in mind\n- Flight history, date, time and flight number\n- Living condition, Family Members, names of her family members his close neighbors\n- Work place, and Colleagues\n- Meetings she had\n- Restaurants he has been to\n\nThis will be a detailed contact tracing system. The form would take awhile to fill in, but it would facilitate contact tracing.",
