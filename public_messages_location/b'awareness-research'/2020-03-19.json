But despite what some corners of social media would have you believe, there\u2019s no evidence from the outbreak that eating garlic, sipping water every 15 minutes or taking vitamin C will protect people from the new coronavirus. Same goes for using essential oils, colloidal silver and steroids.\nSome posts have suggested that putting sesame oil on your body or spraying yourself with alcohol or chlorine will kill the virus. That\u2019s also false.\n\nThere are some chemical disinfectants, including bleach, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform, that may kill the virus on surfaces. But if the virus is already in your body, putting those substances on your skin or under your nose won\u2019t kill it \u2014 and can actually be dangerous.\n\nAnd this should go without saying, but please, please, do not ingest chemical disinfectants either.\nThere\u2019s currently no cure for the novel coronavirus. And while research is underway, it could be more than a year before a vaccine becomes available.\nThe best way to protect yourself right now is to do what you would every cold and flu season. Stay at least three feet away from anyone who may be infected. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze with your elbow or a tissue that you throw away immediately after. And disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch. If you have symptoms that feel worse than a common cold, seek treatment early.\n\nMyth: Black people don\u2019t get coronavirus\n\nReality: Anyone can get coronavirus.\nAny person who comes into close contact with someone who is infected is at risk for contracting the virus, according to the CDC. Take it from Dr. Jennifer Caudle, an African American family medicine physician and on-air health expert who has also been debunking coronavirus myths. Caudle said she worries that some people may not take proper precautions to protect themselves against the virus because they may have heard this myth.\"Black people can get coronavirus, just like other people,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nMyth: Heat can kill the virus\n\nReality: Hand dryers can\u2019t kill the virus, according to WHO. The organization also says that UV lamps shouldn\u2019t be used to sterilize hands or other areas of the body because the radiation can irritate skin.\nPresident Donald Trump has previously suggested that heat kills the virus and that because of this, the current outbreak will have dissipated by spring.\nBut public health experts say there\u2019s no way to know this.\n\nMyth: The virus can be transmitted through mail\n\nReality: Feel free to check your mail.\n\nGetting a letter or package from China won\u2019t put you at risk of contracting the virus, according to WHO.\n\nResearchers are still studying exactly how the new coronavirus infects people, but judging by previous coronaviruses, it doesn\u2019t stay alive for long on objects and surfaces.\n\nMyth: Kids can\u2019t get the coronavirus\n\nReality: Anyone of any age can get the new coronavirus, though older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions appear to be more vulnerable to serious infections.\n\nWhile most confirmed cases of the virus have occurred in adults, children have been infected too, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMyth: People who get the coronavirus will die\n\nReality: Officials estimate the death rate for the virus to be around 3% to 4% globally, based on the information they have, though they expect that number to fall. People who get coronavirus will typically get sick with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a common cold. Symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache and a fever that can last for a couple of days.
