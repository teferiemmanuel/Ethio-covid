        "text": "Hey everyone, regarding helping the MoH identifying hospitals at risk of going over capacity, I had a chat with <@U010T8D05UM> about an approach I was thinking of.\nSo far, the idea was to have the epidemic model work at smaller levels as well as the whole region. This is to help see how COVID-19 is spreading at smaller levels so we can get a good estimate on the influx of patients at specific health facilities. By looking at the capacity of each health facility, you can look at the forecast for that region and identify when the facility will be full or out of resources.\nHere's what I have so far:\n\u2022 Build a geofence using the geojson of the specific region/s you're interested in.\n\u2022 Filter to keep the cases identified within the geofence.\n\u2022 Use the data from those cases to run the model, working with SIR for now(the simplest model I found, to test this with), can be changed.\n\u2022 Return the forecast.\n\u2022 Use some portion of the forecasted infection rate(the percent of infected patients that end up hospitalized) as a measure of the number of incoming patients.\n\u2022 Keep a count of of all beds/the capacity of the facilities in that region, and using the forecast, keep on subtracting until the capacity reaches zero(and adding back when patients are released).\n\nI wrote up a scrappy python script for most of this, but if anyone wants to help in tying it up together or has additional comments, I'm all ears. Of course, this obviously needs more data to be robust, and as Gaelen mentioned, the main parameter that would be affected by regional differences would be the effective contact rate. This is just something to apply later on, once the reported cases start building up.",
