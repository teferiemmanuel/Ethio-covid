Ethiotube has been contacted and has offered willingness to cooperate on this. Our own Mike Endale has been contacted by an Ethiotube staff. We can arrange awareness creation interviews, share videos, and other contents. If you have additional suggestions or contacts, please share them. \n<http://2.In|2. >We can write introductory articles or short news items regarding a general overview of the activities and send them to online news media who have wide readership both in Ethiopia and abroad. Anyone who can write a few paragraphs on any issue regarding the team is welcome to share a workable draft on google doc. please also indicate if there is already something done on this.\n\n( I have checked that google queries of \"Ethiopia COVID-19 Response Team\" or \"Ethiopia COVID-19 Emergency Task Team\" do not yield immediate results on the title, which is not a good sign of being visible.)\n\nregards, Yonas.",
