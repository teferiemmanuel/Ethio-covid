An update on the \"leather mask\" idea:\n\nSo my motivation was that it seems like there are a lot of ideas out there with 3D printing, however if we truly need to produce thousands of masks, there does not seem to be enough 3D printers available in Ethiopia. But, we have a lot of leather available, and a lot of expert leather craftspeople. It would be good to start producing *now,* even if we don't need that many yet, because as we all know, the disease grows exponentially, so it will be very fast when it does hit the upward slope. The reason to use leather instead of cloth is so it can be rigid and seal to the face (important for healthcare workers; cloth may be enough for the general public). We can accomplish this with a thicker leather (think of your shoes).\n\nWe could make masks out of leather by using a 2D pattern that could be cut and sewn into a structured, 3D mask. This is just a simple example I made with a mask-like shape in 3D modeling software, in a real mask we need an opening for the person to breathe, of course. (The tool I used is also designed for metal so that's why it looks that way). The gaps you see are where we would cut and sew, and we would have to seal these so that air does not get through. The big image on the left is the 3D pattern, the small image on the right is the 2D flat pattern. In the image where orange faces are highlighted, you can see how the faces are the same in both the pre-folded state and the folded state. *The basic idea is, it would be the same mask _model_ as the 3D printed ones, but a different _manufacturing process_ and a different _material_ that plays to the strengths of the private sector.* \n\nAny interest in pursuing this further? (before I start typing a long essay about how we could do it lol)",
