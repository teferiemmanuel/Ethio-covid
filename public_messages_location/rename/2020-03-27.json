        "text": "Hi, I came across <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoDwXwZXsDI&amp;list=WL&amp;index=3> which introduced to how the Czechs reached a point were it become compulsory  *to wear something covering a part of your mouth and nose when leaving your residence*.  Links from the video description <https://tiny.cc/masks4all> (Czech story) and,  <http://tiny.cc/maskswork> (research papers and summaries on the benefits of masks)\n\nI understand we would want the little masks we have to be available for the health professionals, as such asking the population to refrain from using masks is a valid request. Then the question is can we do what the Czechs did? I doubt we will be able to, because we might not have enough tools and input materials for making it happen. Even if we did, it might take weeks to reach the level of production that is helpful, or we might want these masks to be first available to the individuals at high risk of contracting the virus and who's services are of utmost importance , for example,  Health Extension Workers, firefighters, police officers and other service providers. I am not saying it is impossible just the cost in time might be too high.\n\nBut, I think we have one cultural advantage, Natela (\u1290\u1320\u120b). The advantage I see are,\n1. significant number of the population have it. Thus, financial cost will not be a hindrance for most,\n2. adaptation of its use can be achieved rapidly. Thus, it doesn't have much cost in time,\n3. Similar communication as used by the Czechs government can be used *\"covering a part of your mouth and nose when leaving your residence\"* instead of \"wear masks\". Thus, it doesn't conflict with existing messaging of not using masks unless you are sick.\n\nA possible disadvantage of using Natela (\u1290\u1320\u120b) is its various form factors. Describing how many time to fold before wearing might differ depending on the different thicknesses. But I am not a marketer, or professional health communicator, so it might not be a big issue.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Then the question is can we do what the Czechs did? I doubt we will be able to, because we might not have enough tools and input materials for making it happen. Even if we did, it might take weeks to reach the level of production that is helpful, or we might want these masks to be first available to the individuals at high risk of contracting the virus and who's services are of utmost importance , for example,  Health Extension Workers, firefighters, police officers and other service providers. I am not saying it is impossible just the cost in time might be too high.\n\nBut, I think we have one cultural advantage, Natela (\u1290\u1320\u120b). The advantage I see are,\n1. significant number of the population have it. Thus, financial cost will not be a hindrance for most,\n2. adaptation of its use can be achieved rapidly. Thus, it doesn't have much cost in time,\n3. Similar communication as used by the Czechs government can be used "

Thus, it doesn't conflict with existing messaging of not using masks unless you are sick.\n\nA possible disadvantage of using Natela (\u1290\u1320\u120b) is its various form factors. Describing how many time to fold before wearing might differ depending on the different thicknesses. But I am not a marketer, or professional health communicator, so it might not be a big issue.\n\nWhat do you think?"

People are out meeting friends and neighbors because they think Covid-19 has been cured. While we isolate ourselves in our home, our helper just came back from celebrating with neighbors. People aren\u2019t listening to reason that there are only 16 known cases here and none are cured so clearly there is no evidence of this. While so many I know are working tirelessly to try to communicate the need for social distancing, not sleeping due to our efforts, and we sit on our hands waiting for approvals, government agencies are communicating false messages giving false hope and sending people into each other\u2019s arms to spread the virus? I don\u2019t mean to stir up the pot. Maybe this was discussed on the call I missed, but it seems to me this changes the entire direction of this group and the urgency of the need for accurate public messaging.",

People are out meeting friends and neighbors because they think Covid-19 has been cured. While we isolate ourselves in our home, our helper just came back from celebrating with neighbors. People aren\u2019t listening to reason that there are only 16 known cases here and none are cured so clearly there is no evidence of this. While so many I know are working tirelessly to try to communicate the need for social distancing, not sleeping due to our efforts, and we sit on our hands waiting for approvals, government agencies are communicating false messages giving false hope and sending people into each other\u2019s arms to spread the virus? I don\u2019t mean to stir up the pot. Maybe this was discussed on the call I missed, but it seems to me this changes the entire direction of this group and the urgency of the need for accurate public messaging."
