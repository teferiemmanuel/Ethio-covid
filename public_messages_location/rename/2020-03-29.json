By the second day, I was having a hard time *swallowing* anything! *My throat hurts!* \n\nIt was *so hard not to panic,* My monkey mind was stronger than ever!\n\nThe 3rd day I used some *_arena_ /\u12a0\u1228\u130d\u122c\u1233/* and it looks like I was just panicking from a regular *Pneumonia (\u121d\u127d)* + a regular *Flu.* Which I have recovered right now *thank God.*\n\n*I believe there are cases like mine which leads to Panicking! Unnecessary phone calls to emergency medical services! Or easily consume false info!* \n\nSo why not build an *online test* that reduces unnecessary emergency traffics and panics? With all current projects going on am confident enough to say we can develop &amp; launch *the simplest Online test* with algorithms that either shows a result _*\"You should see a doctor\"*_ or _*\"Your symptoms are regular\"*_ \n\n_*with methods to cure the problem or further actions suggested if they aren't cured.*_ \n  (Then this data with geolocation in Ethiopia will help us to analyze which areas are highly showing the Covid 19 - *Real symptoms if they ever occur)*  \n\nI build websites for a living *(Am In Gondar, Ethiopia)* but I feel like being a lot better with *UI/UX designing,* So if you believe this could help out *on the side with ongoing projects,* reply and let's do this within *2-3 days!* am willing to put in *every hr on this!*  \n\nSurely we will need *ad campaigns* for people to *run the tests*, People with *Adobe suit, Ui Ux designers* and with *Copywriters* may be *videographers too* for higher quality content, this should be making a huge impact.\nMainly satisfying the term _*\"Speed over Perfection\"  (I know that there are self-test sites that are helping a lot)*_\n_What do you think?_\n\n_On top of all Egziabher Yeker Yebeln!
