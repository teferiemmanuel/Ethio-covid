Everywhere where people are trying to build these devices, they utilize a factory manufactured ambu bag consisting of the face mask and the valves. I was asking about the possibility of obtaining these materials seeing how they are the most difficult to produce locally. If everyone wanting to build a ventilator is going with these bags, then where do the bags come from? We have them at a very limited amount in the country. So before, I was saying that it might be possible to manufacture the bag and asking if you know how to obtain the valves and the face mask that seals over a patient's face. Can they be bought or manufactured easily?",
